## File Renamer
#### Rename Multiple Files in a Folder

This was inspired by, and is based on a gist by [Scriptex](https://gist.github.com/scriptex), [rename.js](https://gist.github.com/scriptex/20536d8cda36221f91d69a6bd4a528b3).
I have modified it to suit my purpose. 
I have been downloading books from [Zlibrary](https://b-ok.cc/) and the downloaded files have a naming format:
##### \[Author\(s\)\]File_name\(z-lib.org\).extension
###### Eg. \[WessCoby\]_Rename_Multiple_Files_in_a_Folder(z-lib.org\).pdf

The Key things i want from this file name string are just the file name and authors(s)
And i want to rename each file to:
##### Filename - Author(s).extension
###### Eg. Rename Multiple Files in a Folder - WessCoby.pdf
